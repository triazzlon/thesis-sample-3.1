    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <p>Welcome to Mutiv, the online and mobile service of Mutiv Pty Ltd (“Mutiv,” “we,” or “us”). Our Privacy Policy explains how Mutiv and its affiliates collect, use, disclose, and protect information that applies to our visual communication platform (the "Service"), and your choices about the collection and use of your information. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given to them in our <a href="T&Cs.html">Terms of Use.</a> If you do not want your information processed 
    in accordance with this Privacy Policy in general or any part of it, you should not use our Service. This policy applies to all users of the Service, including, but not limited to users of our Developer Portal.</p>
    
    <h2>1.Information we Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the following types of information about you:</p>

    <p><strong>(a) Information you provide us directly</strong></p>

    <p>We also collect any messages you send us through the Service (such as user feedback, search queries and prompts), and may collect information you provide in User Content you post to the Service (such as text and photos you upload to use in your designs). We use this information to operate, maintain, improve and provide the features and functionality of the Service to you, to correspond with you, and to address any issues you raise about the Service.

    <p>If you don’t provide your personal information to us, you may not be able to access or use our Service or your experience of using our Service may not be as enjoyable.</p>
    

  <p><strong>(b) Information we receive from third-party applications
  </strong></p>

  <p>We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you access the Service through a third-party connection or log-in, such as Facebook Connect, by “following,” “liking,” adding the Mutiv application, linking your account to the Mutiv Service, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to Mutiv. This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account (for example, your Facebook UID), 
    an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Service. You may also unlink your third party account from the Service by adjusting your settings on the third party service. If you unlink your third party account, 
    we will no longer receive information collected about you in connection with that service. And if you choose to integrate with a third party application to incorporate elements into your designs, enhance media, supercharge your workflow or share to social media, we could receive data from such apps (as well as disclose data to such apps). If you communicate with us via social media, including Instagram, Facebook or TikTok and choose to share your user generated content with us, we may receive information such as videos you’ve created, your photo, your account name and your comments about Mutiv.
