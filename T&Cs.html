    <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
    
    <p><b>Welcome to Mutiv! These Terms of Use (“Terms”) apply to your (“you” or “your”) use of Mutiv’s visual communication platform (the “Service”). By using the Service, you agree that these terms will become a legally binding agreement between you and the Mutiv Contracting Entity identified in these Terms (“Mutiv”).</b></p>
    
    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>a. Using Mutiv. Mutiv is a visual communications platform that empowers people to design and collaborate on virtually anything, from logos and greeting cards, to posters and presentations, to t-shirts and websites (each a “Design”). When you use the Service, you’ll have access to a variety of content provided by Mutiv and other content providers to use in your designs (“Licensed Content”). Your use of the Licensed Content is subject to the Content License Agreement. 
    You also have the option to upload your own content (“User Content”), such as videos, images, and files, which you have full control and responsibility over. You can use Licensed Content, your User Content, and tools available in Mutiv to create your Designs.</p>

    <p>The Service is made available on Mutiv.com, Mutiv mobile apps, Mutiv desktop applications, and in other forms provided or made available by Mutiv. Your use of the Service is subject to these Terms. By using the Service you acknowledge and agree to Mutiv’s <a href="Privacy Policy.html">Privacy Policy.</a></p>

    <p>You may use the Service only if you can form a binding contract with Mutiv and are legally permitted to do so. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you have the full right, power and authority to agree to and be bound by these Terms and to fully perform all of your obligations here under.
    </p>

    <p>b. Signing up with a managed email address. If you sign up for the Service using an email address associated with your employer or another organization (“Admin Entity”), (i) you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind the Admin Entity to these Terms; (ii) your use of the Service will bind your employer or the organization to these Terms; and 
    (iii) “you” and “your” in these Terms will refer to both you and the Admin Entity. The Mutiv account you create using an email address associated with an Admin Entity will be an “Administered Account”.
    </p>

    <p>If you’ve signed up for the Service using an Administered Account, at the Admin Entity’s request, Mutiv may:</p>

    <li>share your email address, name and account information with your Admin Entity; and</li>
    <li>transfer control of the Administered Account to the Admin Entity.</li> 
    <p> If your Administered Account is transferred, the Admin Entity’s admin will be able to access, transfer and control your Administered Account and all content and designs associated with it, as well as: </p>
    <li>make changes to the Administered Account and billing settings and privacy preferences;</li>
    <li>make changes to the folder permissions; and</li>
    <li>delete the Administered Account.</li>

    <p>If your Admin Entity has requested control of your Administered Account, Mutiv will provide you with notice and the opportunity to transfer your content and designs to a personal Mutiv account (subject to you providing us with a valid email address) before the Administered Account is transferred to your Admin Entity. </p>
  
<p>c. Mutiv Teams. Our Mutiv Teams plan is intended for teams, businesses and organizations of all sizes who want to work and design together. If you create a Team on behalf of an organization or employer, you are binding them to these Terms and all the obligations set out in them. If they haven’t authorized you to do this, you’ll need someone who is authorized to create the Team.</p>
