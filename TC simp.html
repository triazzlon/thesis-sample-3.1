    <h1>Terms & Conditions </h1>
    
    <h2>What’s covered in these terms</h2>
    <p>We know it’s tempting to skip these Terms & Conditions, but it’s important to establish what you can expect from us as you use Mutiv services, and what we expect from you. So we’ve made them a bit easier to read.</p>

    <p>These Terms of Service reflect the way that Mutiv’s business works, the laws that apply to our company, and certain things that we’ve always believed to be true. As a result, these Terms of Service help define Mutiv’s relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the following topic headings:
    </p>

    <li>What you can expect from us, which describes how we provide and develop our services</li>
    <li>What we expect from you, which establishes certain rules for using our services</li>
    <li>Content in Mutiv services, which describes the intellectual property rights to the content that you find in our services – whether that content belongs to you, Mutiv or others</li>
    <li>In case of problems or disagreements, which describes other legal rights that you have, and what to expect in case someone violates these terms.</li>

    <p>Understanding these terms is important because, to use our services, you must accept these terms. We encourage you to download these terms for future reference. We make these terms, and all previous versions, available at all times here.</p>

    <p>Besides these terms, we also publish a <a href="Privacy Policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. Although it’s not part of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand how you can update, manage, export and delete your information.</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>Companies or organizations may choose to bring everyone that uses Mutiv with an email address they manage onto one centrally-managed Mutiv account.
    </p>

    <h2>Using the Service</h2>

    <p>There are legal restrictions on making certain services available to children. Our free Mutiv for Education plan for students is compliant with all the laws that apply to children using an online service.</p>

    <h2>Security and Data Privacy</h2>

    <p>We act as a "Data Processor" as per the terms of our Data Processing Addendum:</p>

    <li>if have a Mutiv Teams account; or</li>
    <li>if you are a Mutiv Pro user, to the extent that you are collecting personal data about others through a Mutiv Site or Design.</li>

    <h2>Content and Designs</h2>

    <p>When you upload content to Mutiv, you’re guaranteeing that you have the rights to it. We never obtain any ownership over your content, but we do need you to give us certain rights to store it and have it ready for you to use in your designs.</p>
    <p>We make a variety of content available for you to use in your designs. Certain restrictions apply to how you can use that content and what you can do with the designs you include that content in. The restrictions vary based on the type and source of the content. </p>
    <p>We never own your designs, but there may be certain restrictions depending on the types of Mutiv-provided content you’ve included in your designs.</p>
    <p>There are a number of ways to share your designs with the world. You’re responsible for who you share them with and how you do it.</p>
    <p>You can bring your designs to life on everything from greeting cards and t-shirts to coffee mugs and journals. Printing is done through our print partners and can be delivered to you, or picked up at a partner’s location (where available).
    </p>

    <h2>Use of AI Products</h2>

    <p>You may use AI-powered apps such as (Magic Studio™), including, but not limited to, Magic Media™, Magic Write™, Magic Edit, Magic Design™, Magic Switch™, Magic Grab™, Magic Morph™, Magic Expand™, Magic Eraser, Magic Animate™, Background Remover and 
        Translate and other AI-powered functionality Mutiv may make available on the Service from time to time (collectively, "AI Products").</p>

        <h2>Teams Administration</h2>

        <p>If you’re on a Team on Mutiv Teams, make sure you’re aware of the privacy settings and only upload content and create designs you’re comfortable with others on the Team having access to and control over. Administrators can transfer 
            designs between people on the Team. Keep your personal content and designs to yourself by creating a personal account.</p>

        <h2>Billing</h2>

        <p>The Pay as You Grow model allows you to scale your Team as needed and reconcile costs for anyone who has joined your Team but will no longer need access to the Service before you are billed for them.</p>

        <h2>Mutiv’s Intellectual Property</h2>

        <p>We get great ideas about how to improve Mutiv from our users. If you share feedback or ideas with us, you’re letting us use that information to improve Mutiv, and we own any of those improvements we make.
        </p>


        <h2>Warranty Disclaimer</h2>

        <p>We offer the Service as-is and can’t be responsible for things outside of our control.</p>

        <h2>Third Party Services</h2>

        <p>Within Mutiv, you can use apps created by third parties. Those apps might have their own set of terms that apply to you and because the apps were created by third parties, we can’t be responsible for them.</p>

        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>

        <p>Mutiv’s liability is limited to the greater of $100 or the amount you paid in the past 12 months, and it isn’t responsible for indirect or consequential damages. These limits don’t apply to cases of fraud, gross negligence, 
            willful misconduct, or violations of specific obligations like content misuse or indemnification.</p>

     <h2>Term and Termination</h2>

     <p>If you break the rules, we have the right to remove you and everything in your account from the Service.</p>
